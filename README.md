# [TOP] Sign up form

## Description 
  
The goal of this project is to create a sign up form similiar to [this design](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/5f37d43908ef92499e95a9b90fc3cc291a95014c/html_css/project-sign-up-form/sign-up-form.png). I made this project a little more fun by making my version of this design in figma first and *then* I tried to code it. Excuse me the quality of the art, I ran it (a few times) through a lossy compression algorithm on purpose.
